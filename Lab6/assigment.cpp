/*
Problem)
1) Design a PayRoll class that has data members for an employee’s
hourly pay rate and number of hours worked.
2) Write a program with an array of eleven PayRoll objects.
3) The program should read the number of hours each employee
worked and their hourly pay rate (before tax) from a file and call
class function to store this information in the appropriate objects.
4) It should then call class function, once for each object, to return the
employee’s net pay after 20% tax deduction, so this information
can be displayed.
a. Sample data to test this program can be found in the
payroll.dat file located on Blackboard.
