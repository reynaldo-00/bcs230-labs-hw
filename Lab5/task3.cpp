Task 3:
Write a program that displays the Roman numerals
equivalent of any decimal number between 1 and 20 that
the user enters.
Step1:
Ø First store the Roman numerals in an array.
Ø Create a function that allows you to enter the integer numbers from
1-20.
Ø Print the Roman numeral value of the entered integer.
Ø Loop to allow the user to continue entering numbers until an end
sentinel of 0 is entered.
Roman Integer
I 1
V 5
X 10
L 50
C 100
D 500
M 1000
Lab05	- BCS230,	M.	Alrajab	 3
Step2:
Ø Redesign your program based on OOP principles so that you create
a class called IntRomanType (with header and source).
Ø Create a member function that converts any integer from 1 to 5000
to Roman numerals.
Ø Test your class using main function (you should have three files:
IntRomanType.cpp, IntRomanType.h and main.cpp).
Ø Loop to allow the user to continue entering numbers until an end
sentinel of 0 is entered.
Step3:
Ø Put together the code from lab04-task2 and this task-step2 to make
a program that converts a number both ways. You need to provide
a menu for the user to select either R2I (Roman to Integer) or I2R.
Menu design should include screen control such as clearing the
screen before printing.
