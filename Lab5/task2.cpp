/*
The magic square is a grid with three rows and three columns that has the
following properties:
• The grid contains the numbers from 1 through 9 exactly.
• The sum of each row, each column, each diagonal all add up to
the same number. This is shown in the following:
4 9 2 15
2 5 7 15
8 1 6 15
15 15 15 15
Write a program that simulates a magic square using a two-dimensional
3x3 array. It should have a Boolean function isMagicSquare that accepts
the array as an argument and returns true if it determines it is a Magic
Square and false if it is not. Test the program with one array that is a
magic square and one that is not.
